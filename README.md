Welcome to the official repository of Turbo Demo Games - a collection of sample games created using the Turbo game engine. These demos are designed to showcase the capabilities of Turbo and provide inspiration for your game development projects.

## Getting Started

First, [install Turbo](https://docs.turbo.computer)

Next, clone this repository to explore the demo games:

```bash

Each demo game is contained in its own directory and includes source code and assets.

## Running the Demos

From the root of the project, you can run the following command:

```bash
turbo run -w <demo-name>
```

For example, to run the Bork Runner game demo:
